# Microservices

- Microservices are the architectural and the organizational approach to software development
- where software is composed of small independent services that communicate over well defined API's
- These services are owned by small,self-contained teams


# Difference between Monolithic and Microservices 

# Monolithic                                           

- all process are tightly coupled and run as a single service
- one process of application experience a spike in demand and the entire architecture scaled.
- adding or improving monolithic application features becomes more complex as the code base grows.
- The complexity limits and experimentation and makes it difficult to implement new ideas
- monolithic architectures add risk for application availability because many dependent and tightly coupled process increase the impact of single process failure


# Microservices 
- an application is Built as independent coponents that run each application process as a services
- These services communicate via well-defined interface using light weight API's
- services are Built for business capabilities and each services performs a single function
- Because they are independently run each service can be udated deployed and scaled to meet demand for specific functions of an application
